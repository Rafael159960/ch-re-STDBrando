##### 1.5	Overview
The rest of this document will cointain information of the system. 
Section 2 will give an overall description of the system, it will talk about the people involved in it, what will the system will be expected to do, functions and constraints.
Section 3 will focus on the specific requirements the system has to deliver.
### 2. Overall Description
##### 2.1. Product Perspective
This system consists of a application that will save a number of appointments each one with a set of customer information in a database.
Each time the employee has to create, modify or delete, there will be a number of components in the interface so the system can communicate with the database and apply these changes.
##### 2.2	Product Functions
Main actions that the system should perform:
* Create, modify and delete patient information
* Generate a reports that contains the costs of the clinical trial
* Manage information of the doctors in the clinic and patients assigned
* Manage users (employee data and information) into system
* Manage trial information (prices, trial available)
##### 2.3	User characteristics
| User    | Details           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Employee | The employee will play the role of capturing customer data, also modifying any data. They will be also working with the doctor's data(add patients, add doctors, modify doctor information). |

* An Administrator should be able to modify all the data that the employee(user) can.
* One employee should be using the system at the time
